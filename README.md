The Wine Quality Data Analysis project aims to create a standardized method for assessing the quality of wine using data-driven approaches that combine physicochemical testing and sensory evaluation data. The project will develop a model that includes the key indicators of wine quality and will help to provide consistent and objective evaluations of wine quality. By using data visualization, the project team will identify patterns and relationships in the data to improve the model's accuracy. Ultimately, the project will help wine manufacturers improve their products' quality and enhance the overall consumer experience.
