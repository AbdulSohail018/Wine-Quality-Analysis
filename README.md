# Wine Quality Data Analysis Project <br/>
**Objective:** <br/>
The Wine Quality Data Analysis project aims to establish a standardized method for assessing the quality of wine using data-driven approaches that combine physicochemical testing and sensory evaluation data. The project's key objectives include developing a model that incorporates the key indicators of wine quality and providing consistent and objective evaluations. Through data visualization, the project team will identify patterns and relationships to enhance the model's accuracy. Ultimately, this project contributes to improving wine manufacturers' product quality and enhancing the overall consumer experience.
